# Final Project - Digital Juke Box

## Overview
The final project for CS 373 - Digital Logic Design focuses on implementing a hardware-based music jukebox/gizmo using the BASYS 3 FPGA board, a pmod I2S audio module, and a connected speaker. Our project generates square wave frequencies to produce music tones and allows user interaction to modify the frequency using the switches on the board. The primary goal was to enable sound generation through toggling switches, and resetting the sound using a pushbutton.

## Project Team
- **Instructor:** Kent Jones
- **Team Members:** Wes Ostlund, James Lee, Salim Dhahri

## Features
- Connects the BASYS 3 board to an I2S audio module for playing sounds.
- Allows frequency modification via switches on the board.
- Pushbutton to reset the tone to the default.
- Programmed using Vivado with a custom VHDL code to drive the audio output.

## VHDL Usage
VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) was the primary programming language used to describe the behavior and structure of the digital logic in this project. Here's how it was utilized:

- **Tone Generation:** VHDL was used to design a frequency generator that produces square wave tones. The frequency of the square waves is adjusted based on the switches on the BASYS 3 board, controlling the pitch of the audio.
  
- **I2S Communication:** VHDL was implemented to communicate with the I2S audio module, enabling the FPGA to send audio data to the module. This required creating a custom VHDL module that transmitted audio samples in the I2S format, which the audio module could then process and output as sound.

- **Input Control:** The switches on the BASYS 3 board, as well as the pushbutton, were integrated into the VHDL code to control the frequency and reset functionality. The switches allowed dynamic frequency adjustment, and the pushbutton provided a reset mechanism to return to the default sound.

- **Clock Division:** VHDL was used to implement a clock divider that enabled precise control over the timing of the generated tones, ensuring accurate sound output.

The VHDL code was synthesized and programmed onto the FPGA using Vivado, which then controlled the music output and user interactions.

## How to Use
1. **Connect Hardware:**
   - Ensure the I2S module is correctly connected to the BASYS 3 board.
   - Connect the I2S module to the speaker using an audio jack.
2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the `gen.sh` script in your terminal to compile and load the VHDL code to the FPGA board.
3. **Interact with the System:**
   - Once the board is programmed, use the switches to modify the generated frequency, thus changing the sound output.
   - Press the central pushbutton to reset the tone to the default.

## Assumptions
- The user has access to the hardware components, including the BASYS 3 board, I2S module, audio jack connector, and speaker.
- The user is capable of connecting these components correctly and has access to a terminal to execute the `gen.sh` script for programming the FPGA.

## Conclusion
This project has successfully demonstrated how to use digital logic design to implement a hardware-based music generator on the BASYS 3 board. By utilizing VHDL and the I2S audio module, we were able to generate audio signals and provide an interactive experience for the user. This project showcases the power of digital hardware and provides a foundation for future expansion, such as incorporating more complex music or sound effects.
